conclusion
==========
- hard to manage std deps (hard to find path,...)
- error with iterable typing
- fmt not configurable => https://dprint.dev/cli/
- can't filter spec test
- small config params for eslint and not configurable
- can't configure coverage for now
- handle version as v6.3.2 and 6.3.2 => no convention
